# UPDATES

### [MAY 23, 2024: Archive 'Alpha'](/_archive/05_23.zip)

'Alpha' helped drive out [db schema](/_notes/scavenger-db-05-23.png). Components from 'Alpha' may be repurposed in 'Beta'. 'Alpha' started in React and 'Beta' will remain a React project.

> **LESSONS LEARNED:**
>
> - Frontend discovery really helped me understand what the data structure should look like for a 'production level' version of this application
> - I had no concrete timeline for 'Alpha', 'Beta' should be much more strict
> - Fully functional 'Beta' needed by **07/31/24** if this is going to be used in late August
> - I had not thought about the backend or the db when beginning the 'Alpha' more than "I'll need one of each"
> - I found how I wanted the app to flow with the frontend work completed in the 'Alpha'--this likely could be done nmore efficiently using a tool like Figma in the future
> - Getting back into React with this 'Alpha' was a huge win personally
